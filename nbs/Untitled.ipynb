      "The daughter of a Melbourne man who is missing in Turkey following the region’s devastating earthquakes has pleaded for more help to find her father as the search enters its fifth day. Coburg woman Imren Bayram is still desperate to find her missing father Suat , who was in Kirikhan in the Turkish region of Hatay when the disaster occurred. Suat Bayram (right) with nephew Ulas Hussam and wife Bahar, who are all missing in Kirikhan, Hatay, after the earthquake. The 69-year-old man from Greenvale was visiting family in Cyprus for five weeks and was in Turkey with his nephew and his nephew’s wife, Ulas and Bahar Hussam. Four Australians, including Suat Bayram, had been reported missing. The body of Sydney man Can Pahali was found in Turkey on Thursday, the first confirmed Australian death of the tragedy. Foreign Minister Penny Wong on Friday confirmed another Australian reported missing had been located. The identity of the person is not yet known. Five days after the deadly earthquakes which left more than 20,000 dead , the Bayram family wants the Australian government to do more to find their beloved father and grandfather. “My heart goes out to everybody who has been affected by this earthquake and anyone who has family there, it’s been a nightmare,” Imren Bayram said on Friday. She said she wanted to see Australian troops or emergency staff sent to the address where her father was staying. Bayram said she had spoken to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which passed on her request. She was also told the government was in contact with the embassy in Ankara. “We’ve also contacted them and they’re checking hospital records to see if my father has been in hospital. They’re doing that,” she said. Greenvale man Suat Bayram, 69, was visiting Turkey with family when the deadly earthquakes struck. Bayram has reached out to politicians in a bid to get more assistance, but said DFAT told her it was the Turkish government that decided where aid and assistance would be allocated. “I’m getting closed doors everywhere I go,” she said. Bayram had also been in touch with humanitarian organisations in a bid to find more information about what was happening on the ground. “I’m constantly on the phone, constantly trying to do what we can to have action taken. My brother-in-law is there. He left Australia a couple of days ago, so he should be getting there soon, we’re doing everything we possibly can [to find him].” The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing consular assistance to the family of Pahali and to the families of another two Australians who remained unaccounted for. DFAT said its teams in Turkey and Lebanon were supporting around 60 Australians and their families who were in the earthquake zone and that diplomatic missions in Ankara, Istanbul and Beirut were doing all they could to support families and reach out to Australians reported to be in the area. More than 20,000 people have been confirmed dead after this week’s earthquakes in southern Turkey and northern Syria, which were recorded as being of magnitudes of 7.8 and 7.5. About 4000 people gathered at the Melbourne Grand Mosque in Tarneit, in Melbourne’s west, on Friday afternoon to pray for those affected by the earthquakes. Mosque president Rifai Raheem said he saw many new faces at the prayer service, which are usually held twice a day and attended by about 3000 people on Fridays. Raheem said a member of the community who was visiting family in Turkey when the earthquake struck called on Thursday night and asked him to pray for them. “He was crying, he lost two of his cousins. He says: ‘I can’t describe this situation. It’s like judgement day. It’s like the end of the world.’ ” Raheem said many in the community were desperate to help and that people had queued to contribute money to the earthquake relief effort. Fazilet Baskan, a volunteer for Islamic Relief, said attendees at Friday’s service donated out of a sense of compassion, raising at least $25,000 for the global aid organisation. “When the body aches, we all feel it.

      "“A friend recently sent through the temporary rules applying to Richmond Golf Club in England in 1940,” writes Malcolm McEwen of North Turramurra. “German aircraft returning to Norway would clear their guns as they crossed the coast by firing a few rounds at golf courses. Among the rules: ‘In competition, during gunfire or while bombs are falling, players may take cover without penalty for ceasing play.’ They could also take a shot from a bomb crater without penalty, but my favourite is this: ‘A player whose stroke is affected by the simultaneous explosion of a bomb may play another ball from the same place. Penalty one stroke.’ Tough but fair. I wondered why you’d play during a bombing raid, but then I know a few golfers.” Marjie Williamson of Blaxland recalls: “A ride to Manly by ferry was exhilarating in my far-off youth. Now, reading about the unseaworthiness (C8) of the new ferries, maybe I’ll forgo that pleasure or have some swimming lessons.” It’s a mug’s game, reckons Evan Bailey of Glebe: “Of course, there’s no sign of Dave Warner From The Suburbs (C8), as he sadly sings: ‘I know what it’s like, to be rejected every night.’” “I saw a wonderful production of Summer of the Seventeenth Doll at the Genesian Theatre the other night,” says Ros Bilbe of Lindfield. “Sadly, there were not many bums on seats. The company performs in one of Sydney’s oldest churches, soon to be re-designed by developers. Having seen the play many times, including London’s West End in the 1950s, I think this production is my favourite.” The company will remain at Kent Street for the rest of 2022 before relocating to Rozelle. Seppo Ranki of Glenhaven is game: “I’m with Nola Tucker on expanding the Commonwealth Games (C8) repertoire to Welly throwing. Why not add the Finnish classic wife-carrying contest or a game of Finska, which should be at least as interesting as lawn bowls.” According to Anne Cook of Ermington, a person’s name consisting of one word (C8) is known as a mononym and as to those mononymic celebrities who left us too soon, she suggests Prince. “During the Vietnam War, a town in the Australian operational area was Dat Do – which the Aussies immediately rechristened Dapto (C8),” reports Lance Rainey of Rushforth.  \n",

      "Jockeys “tend to follow the flock like sheep”; great jockeys think outside the square, have their own opinion and back their judgment, as Nash Rawiller expressed to Melbourne media. Rawiller produced two rides – one daring or possibly dangerous - at the recent Royal Randwick Championships that rate with the all-time controversial. In fact, it is doubtful whether their like has ever been seen before on consecutive Saturdays. However, the powerhouse hoop’s comment was centred around his son, Campbell, an apprentice now based in South Australia. In search of better ground, Rawiller senior plotted a successful course high and wide in the Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Randwick. But Campbell zigzagged in and out on the Oakbank circuit last Saturday, covering far more territory to score on Plympton. Still, Nash Rawiller’s two triumphs, in some ways epic, challenged the rules of race riding at Randwick, while the expertise of rivals - including James McDonald and Tom Berry - last Saturday emphasised the current high quality of Sydney jockeys. James McDonald salutes the Randwick crowd after winning the All Aged Stakes on Cascadian. Credit: Getty JMac’s handling of Cascadian, finding the best lanes in a testing mine-field, to take the All Aged Stakes last Saturday was superb; winning on a mount few, if any others, could. And while conditions favoured She’s Extreme in the Champagne Stakes, Berry’s stopwatch timing between the 600 metres to the 400 metres contributed to end the winning streak of Fireburn. No doubt the “C” word is thrown around with abandon but watching JMac currently is a highlight, challenging the view whether he compares with the best ever. Tommy Smith, always the reference for such matter, chose jockeys, including champions like George Moore, on the grounds: “Put them on five favourites and get five good rides, not necessarily winners, and you are cooking with the right recipe”. JMac has eight rides on mostly favourites at Randwick on Saturday, giving a Moore-like lift to a benchmark meeting, strong on numbers but suspect class. Nash Rawiller (far left, blue silks) muscles Kementari down the rails in the tightest of gaps. Credit: Getty Moore, too, never followed the flock and had a knack with inside runs. Alas, Rawiller rode the fine line between careless and courageous to get the Championships double. But it necessitated suspensions and fines, which received mixed reaction from critics, particularly Kementari in last Saturday’s Hall Mark Stakes. In decades hence his saddle pluck will be remembered, forcing a fence-scraping run shunned by most navigators. Fortunately, he had the benefit of the pliable aluminium rail and not the former wooden variety, otherwise the gelding, at best, would have ended with a flank loaded with splinters and the possibility of being impaled. Following Kementari, Rawiller’s suspensions end on May 13. Maybe I’m rusted into old-time punter philosophy: going wherever human and horse can go by any means justifiable by circumstances within the rules. Nash Rawiller and Kementari go on to win the Hall Mark Stakes at Randwick last week. Credit: Getty Still, most trainers felt the Rawiller tactic on Kementari was “dangerous” and should have carried a more serious change than careless riding. “How close was it to a fall?” was decreed. Yes, the injured party, minor placegetter Big Parade, was left staggering in Kementari’s wake. Darren Beadman, without peer on horseback, found in favour of Rawiller with “anticipation” being his guideline. The negative of Rawiller’s Queen Elizabeth was breaching the contentious whip rule, for which he was originally suspended and fined $40,000, but it was chopped back to $30,000 on appeal. When will stewards relegate for a savage breach of the whip rule? Race riding is one of the most precarious sports or occupations with a balance between safety and instinct. Generally, modern-day jockeys play it right, unlike the Golden Slippers of old, once saddle mayhem. Remember the 1996 chapter featuring Greg Hall on Merlene? Hall ended with a two-month suspension and $50,000 fine for what was decreed by chief stipe Ray Murrihy as “blatant carelessness”. Hall was no sheep and proclaimed a higher order. “Jet pilots don’t have rear-vision mirrors,” he argued. News, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.
